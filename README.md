Restaurant Website Project

This project, completed as part of a module assignment for my bachelor's degree at University Academy 92, aims to create a website for a restaurant owner looking to expand their business by establishing an online presence. The primary objectives include:

Increased Reachability: The owner seeks to make the restaurant more accessible to potential customers by introducing a website.

Automated Table Booking: Implementing an online booking system to automate the reservation process, allowing the owner to focus more on customer service and food preparation.

Online Ordering Service: Introducing an online ordering service to enable customers to order food remotely, thereby increasing profitability and convenience for customers.

By addressing these objectives, the project aims to modernize the restaurant's operations and enhance its overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
